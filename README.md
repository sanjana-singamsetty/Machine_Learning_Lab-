This repository serves as a centralized hub to document and track my progress in the machine lab over the course of three months. 
## Introduction to Numpy

### Question 1:
Write a NumPy program to multiply two given arrays of the same size element-by-element.

### Question 2:
Write a NumPy program to find the missing data in a given array.

### Question 3:
Write a NumPy program to test whether each element of a 1-D array is also present in a second array.

### Question 4:
Write a NumPy program to save a NumPy array to a text file.

### Question 5:
Write a NumPy program to Create a 1-D array of 30 evenly spaced elements between 2.5. and 6.5, inclusive.

## Introduction to Pandas (Series and Dataframes)

### Question 1:
Write a Pandas program to convert Series of lists to one Series.

### Question 2:
Write a Pandas program to create a subset of a given series based on value and condition.

### Question 3:
Write a Pandas program to display the most frequent value in a given series and replace everything else as 'Other' in the series.

### Question 4:
Write a Pandas program to find the positions of numbers that are multiples of 5 of a given series.

### Question 5:
Write a Pandas program to calculate the number of characters in each word in a given series.

### Question 6:
Write a Pandas program to convert year-month string to dates adding a specified day of the month.

### Question 7:
Write a Pandas program to create and display a DataFrame from a specified dictionary data which has the index labels.

### Question 8:
Write a Pandas program to select the rows where the number of attempts in the examination is greater than 2.

### Question 9:
Write a Pandas program to append a new row 'k' to the data frame with given values for each column. Now delete the new row and return the original DataFrame.

### Question 10:
Write a Pandas program to sort the DataFrame first by 'name' in descending order, then by 'score' in ascending order.

### Question 11:
Write a Pandas program to replace the 'qualify' column contains the values 'yes' and 'no' with True and False.

### Question 12:
Write a Pandas program to remove infinite values from a given DataFrame.
