## Introduction

The Machine Learning Lab is designed to provide participants with hands-on experience and practical skills in machine learning. Over the course of four months, we will delve into essential Python libraries for data manipulation and analysis, laying the groundwork for advanced machine learning concepts.

## Topics Covered

1. **Lab 1: Introduction to NumPy and Pandas**
   - Introduction to NumPy
   - Introduction to Pandas (Series and Dataframes)
